# NN_with_sense_of_humour
* In this project I will try to train GPT2 to make jokes!
I will use the GPT-2 model from the hugging face. Everything will be written on the Pwtorch framework.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle, link https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes
This is my first project put on public display, so there aren't a lot of comments, but I hope they can point out my mistakes.
